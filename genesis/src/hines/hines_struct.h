	**
	** Kernel-entry protocol (see GPU_HINES_SOLVE_DESIGN.md "kernel design
	** groundwork" section for the full derivation from hines_init.c's
	** emission code): a work-item for tree k does NOT just point at
	** fwd_seg_start[k]/bwd_seg_start[k] and run the generic interpreter --
	** the single-threaded code's implicit row-0/row-1 bootstrap and its
	** one-global-"soma" special case do not exist per-tree in the source,

	**            relies on that flush target belonging to the PREVIOUS
	**            tree, which does not exist for an isolated work-item).
	**   Root solve: after the forward segment's own FINISH/next-tree
	**            boundary, do resultval/=diaval; vm[fwd_root_row[k]]=
	**            results[2*fwd_root_row[k]]=resultval directly -- this
	**            uniformly replaces BOTH the single-threaded code's
	**            "last row" special case (previously only the one tree at
	**            hnum==ncompts-1 got this) AND the backward pass's root
	**            CALC_RESULTS (previously every other tree's root got IT

	**            treatment here, so neither of those single-threaded-only
	**            code paths needs reproducing.
