# Multi-compartment tree-elimination campaign, end-to-end wall clock.
#
# 51_weekend_campaign.sh reports RESULT_T_PER_STEP for both arms, so unlike the
# single-compartment campaign it is at least internally consistent -- but it is
# a step-phase number, which excludes model construction. For a population of
# 50,000 x 16 compartments construction is tens of seconds, so the step-phase
# ratio is not what a user experiences.
#
# This runs the same sweep with wall clock around the whole process, matching
# 53_singlecomp_walltime.sh so both tables in the paper rest on one definition.
# Linear-chain only: the branching topology gives statistically indistinguishable
# speedups and is already omitted from the figure.
#
# Overridable: REPS (default 10), STEPS (default 200), NLIST.
