# Single-compartment multiloop campaign with BOTH arms timed the same way.
#
# Why this exists: 52_cuda_singlecomp_campaign.sh takes the CPU number from
# GENESIS's own {cpu} step-loop timer and the GPU number from the device-side
# "CUDA MULTILOOP: ... total X ms" kernel report. Those are different
# quantities -- the GPU side excludes host work, transfers and construction --
# so their ratio is not a speedup of anything a user experiences, and it is
# inflated. Reviewer 2 of SOFTX-D-26-00952 raised exactly this.
#
# Here both arms are wall-clock around the whole process, so the ratio is an
# end-to-end speedup including construction, transfers and per-step host work.
# The step-phase figure remains available from each arm's own internal report;
# this script deliberately does not mix the two definitions.
#
# Overridable: REPS (default 10), STEPS (default 50000).
