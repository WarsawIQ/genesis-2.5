"""Where GENESIS 2.5 overtakes Arbor, as a function of run length.

Both simulators are linear in the number of steps, with different intercepts and
slopes: Arbor starts ahead on setup, GENESIS advances each step more cheaply.
The lines therefore cross, and the crossing is the result -- neither simulator
is faster in general, and a single-run-length comparison would report whichever
side of it the author happened to pick.

Reads whatever K values are present, so it works with the two-point measurement
and with a fuller sweep. Only the GPU arms are plotted; the CPU arms belong to a
different comparison and are two orders of magnitude away.
