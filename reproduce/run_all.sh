#   sh reproduce/run_all.sh --quick     ~15 min, the accelerator claims
#   sh reproduce/run_all.sh             ~95 min, adds the sweeps and the
#                                       spiking network
#   sh reproduce/run_all.sh --with-neuron   adds the cross-simulator comparison
#
# Every stage writes a CSV under reproduce/results/ and appends one line per
# claim to reproduce/results/summary.csv. compare.py then prints measured
# against published with a pass/fail per claim, so the output is a verdict
# rather than a pile of numbers to interpret.
#
# What you need: Linux x86_64, GCC, GNU make, a CUDA 12.x toolkit and an NVIDIA
# GPU. --with-neuron additionally needs NEURON 9.x (pip install neuron) and,
# for the Arbor arm, an Arbor built with CUDA. Neither is required for the
# GENESIS claims, which are the ones this paper makes.
#
# Numbers will not match to the last digit. GPU clock state, card model and
# host CPU all move them; the tolerances in expected.csv are set accordingly,
# and the shape of each result -- which arm wins, and by roughly how much --
# is what should reproduce.
