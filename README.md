# GENESIS 2.5

GENESIS 2.5 is GENESIS 2.4 / PGENESIS 2.4 with two new, optional accelerator
backends for the `hsolve` compartmental solver: OpenCL and CUDA, on the same
interface. Nothing about the existing CPU, MPI, model files, or SLI scripts
changes. If you don't turn a GPU backend on, GENESIS behaves exactly as it
did in 2.4.

Along the way we also found and fixed some pre-existing bugs that have
nothing to do with GPUs: three Hines-solver defects that silently dropped
`inject`-driven voltage transients in multi-neuron `hsolve` setups, and five
`O(n²)` linear-scan patterns in element creation and `hsolve` setup that made
building large models effectively quadratic in time. Both fixes benefit any
GENESIS/PGENESIS user, accelerated or not.

A manuscript describing all of this is being prepared for submission to
[SoftwareX](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/softwarex); the current
draft is [`paper/manuscript_softwarex_submission.pdf`](paper/manuscript_softwarex_submission.pdf).
See [Citing this work](#citing-this-work) below.

## Important: defect in the v2.5 release, fixed after it

**If you ran the `v2.5` tag (or its Zenodo archive) with `chanmode=4`/`5` on a
model that uses synaptic channels, a `spike` element, GHK, or calcium
concentration pools, the results are wrong.** Re-run on current `master`.

The GPU kernels implement five opcodes and silently ignore any other — without
skipping its operands. The first unhandled opcode therefore desynchronises the
walk over the solver's `ops[]` program, and every later coefficient read lands
on a wrong index. `SPIKE_OP` carries two operands, so a soma with a `spike`
element is enough. There is no error message; membrane voltage is wrong from
the first step and typically diverges.

The detection for this already existed — `build_comp_index()` marked the
affected compartments — but the mask was computed and freed without ever being
consulted, and the CUDA port omitted it entirely.

It went unnoticed because every validation model in this repository uses only
`tabchannel` elements driven by `inject`, which never trips it. It shows up
immediately on a real network model: on the bundled
[`genesis/Scripts/VAnet2`](genesis/Scripts/VAnet2) (Vogels & Abbott 2005, as
published in Brette et al. 2007, ModelDB 83319) the CUDA backend produced
Vm = 1.5 V at t = 0 against a correct −0.065 V.

Fixed in commit `5027e73`: both backends now refuse such a model, print which
compartments are affected, and fall back to the CPU solver for that `hsolve`.
Verified byte-identical to the CPU reference over the full VAnet2 run.

**Unaffected:** models built only from `tabchannel` elements and driven by
`inject`, including every benchmark under `genesis/Scripts/benchmark/`. The
speedup figures below were measured on those and are not touched by this.

## Where the speedups come from

Two numbers are worth separating, because they answer different questions.
**Step-phase** times the simulation loop alone and measures what the kernel
can do; **end-to-end** wall-clocks the whole process, model construction
included, and is what you actually wait for. We quote both.

For single-compartment (isopotential) networks, a batched multi-step
"multiloop" kernel reaches 21.0x (A40) and 21.9x (A100) end-to-end at
N=50,000, matching the fp64 CPU reference to about 1e-7 V.

That kernel updates each compartment independently, which is only correct
for isopotential cells. Real dendritic trees need the Hines tridiagonal
elimination, so we added a second kernel, `hines_tree_eliminate`, that runs
the same elimination the CPU solver does, one GPU thread per neuron. On the
UMCS cluster, 10 replicates each, at N=50,000 neurons x 16 compartments that
is 37.3x (A40) and 80.8x (A100) step-phase, still climbing with N, but
3.6x and 3.9x end-to-end. The gap is not a kernel deficiency: these runs are
only 200 steps, so the unaccelerated construction phase dominates, and the
end-to-end figure rises toward the step-phase ceiling as runs lengthen.

Against other simulators, on the Vogels-Abbott COBAHH network (4000 cells,
5 s, single-threaded CPU on one cluster node) GENESIS 2.5 finishes in
46.9 ± 2.1 s against 76.5 ± 0.3 s for CoreNEURON and 95.8 ± 0.2 s for
NEURON 9.0.2 — 1.63x and 2.04x respectively. Both networks match in size,
connectivity, stimulation protocol and firing rate (26.8 vs 27.9 Hz); the
harness and the equivalence checks are in
[`cluster_bringup/coreneuron/`](cluster_bringup/coreneuron/).

Pushing that multi-compartment benchmark toward a Blue Brain Project-scale
population (~31,000 neurons) is what surfaced the O(n²) construction bug
mentioned above — before the fix, that model didn't finish building at all;
after, a 1.7-million-compartment, N=100,000 population builds in
51.5 ± 0.6 s.

The methodology, the confounds we ran into and had to rule out, and the raw

## Repository layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `genesis/` | GENESIS 2.4 source (from the November 2014 public release) plus the OpenCL (`genesis/src/hines/opencl/`) and CUDA (`genesis/src/hines/cuda/`) backends and the `hines_tree_eliminate` kernel |
| `pgenesis/` | Official PGENESIS 2.4 (MPI) release |
| `genesis-binaries/` | Pre-compiled binaries (e.g. Cygwin) inherited from upstream |
| `cluster_bringup/` | Scripts to build, validate, and benchmark on a GPU cluster (used on UMCS A40/A100 nodes) |
| `experiments/` | Benchmark drivers, raw data, and plotting scripts behind the paper's figures |
| `paper/` | The manuscript, replication guide, figures, and design notes |

## Requirements

Linux, x86_64, GCC, GNU Make. Beyond that:

- OpenCL backend: an OpenCL 1.2+ runtime (we've used ROCm 6.3.1 and Mesa
  rusticl)
- CUDA backend: CUDA 12.x (tested with 12.8 on `sm_89`/RTX 4090,
  `sm_80`/A100, `sm_86`/A40)
- PGENESIS: an MPI implementation (MPICH/Hydra or Open MPI)

Neither GPU backend is required.

## Building

Plain CPU/MPI, same as GENESIS 2.4:
```sh
cd genesis/src
make clean; make; make install
```

OpenCL:
```sh
cd genesis/src
make USE_OPENCL=1 nxgenesis
```
This builds `hsolve`'s OpenCL kernels (`genesis/src/hines/opencl/ocl_channel.cl`)
into `nxgenesis` and links `-lOpenCL`. A run that actually reaches the GPU
prints a non-empty `OCL PROFILING SUMMARY` at exit; if it falls back to CPU
(no channels attached, or the kernel failed to build), that line is absent.

CUDA:
```sh
cd genesis/src
make USE_CUDA=1 CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda nxgenesis
```
The CUDA kernels are a line-for-line fp32 port of the OpenCL ones behind the
same entry point. If both `USE_OPENCL` and `USE_CUDA` are defined, CUDA
wins. The linker step is the fiddly part: the default `EXTRALIBS` already
carries `sprng` and `TERMCAP`, and a bare `EXTRALIBS=-lcudart` will silently
drop both instead of adding to them. See
[`genesis/src/hines/cuda/BUILD_CUDA.md`](genesis/src/hines/cuda/BUILD_CUDA.md)
for the full invocation, or just use
[`cluster_bringup/10_build.sh`](cluster_bringup/10_build.sh), which also
picks the right `-arch` for whatever GPU it finds.

## Using the accelerator backends

Both backends kick in automatically for any `hsolve` element using
`chanmode=4` (or `5`) with real ion-channel state — no model changes needed.
A tree with more than one compartment goes to `hines_tree_eliminate`;
single-compartment networks use the cheaper per-compartment multiloop kernel.
A few environment variables control dispatch at run time:

| Variable | Effect |
|---|---|
| `GENESIS_OCL_MULTILOOP=<K>` | Batch `K` steps into one OpenCL dispatch instead of one per step |
| `GENESIS_CUDA_MULTILOOP=<K>` | Same, CUDA |
| `GENESIS_OCL_TREE_MAX_NCOMPTS=<N>` | Safety cap for laptop integrated GPUs, which can hang past ~22,000-24,000 compartments when the same chip also drives the display. Confirmed not to affect dedicated GPUs (verified on A40 well beyond that size), so set `0` on any datacenter or desktop card |

**If you run multi-compartment models larger than 20,000 compartments on a
dedicated GPU, set `GENESIS_OCL_TREE_MAX_NCOMPTS=0`.** That cap defaults to
20,000, and above it the batched tree solver declines the model and falls back
to per-step dispatch. The run still produces correct results, but much more
slowly -- at 800,000 compartments the difference measured 3-7x, larger on the
faster card, because the per-step launch overhead is fixed. The fallback prints
a line to stderr, which is easy to lose in a batch script that redirects it.

The kernel-selection logic is in the manuscript's "Software architecture"
section; the derivation of `hines_tree_eliminate` itself, including the
dead ends, is in
[`genesis/src/hines/GPU_HINES_SOLVE_DESIGN.md`](genesis/src/hines/GPU_HINES_SOLVE_DESIGN.md).

## Reproducing the benchmarks

One command re-measures the paper's numbers on your own hardware:

```sh
sh reproduce/run_all.sh --quick   # ~15 min, the accelerator claims
sh reproduce/run_all.sh           # ~95 min, adds the sweeps and the spiking network
```

It builds, checks the fp32 accelerator against the fp64 CPU solver, measures the
speedups, compares the spiking network's CPU and GPU arms on spike count,
regenerates the figures from those measurements, and prints each published value
beside yours with a verdict. Needs a CUDA 12.x toolkit and an NVIDIA GPU; no
root, no scheduler.

[`reproduce/README.md`](reproduce/README.md) maps every figure and table in the
paper to what reproduces it, including the two rows this pack cannot reach and
where their raw logs are, and lists the four things that move timings enough to
matter.


## Why "2.5" and not "3.0"

"GENESIS 3" was a separate modularization effort that ended up as several
independent successors (Neurospaces/Heccer, MOOSE) rather than a drop-in
replacement for GENESIS 2.4. This isn't that. GENESIS 2.5 doesn't
re-architect anything — it's meant for people already running GENESIS 2.4
who want GPU acceleration without touching their models or scripts.
